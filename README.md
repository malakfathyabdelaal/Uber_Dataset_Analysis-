# Uber_Dataset_Analysis-
A data analysis and clustering project on Uber trip data using K-Means and PCA to uncover patterns in ride behavior, peak hours, and geographic trends. Includes visualizations and dimensionality reduction for better insights.

# Uber Trips Clustering 🚕📊

This project analyzes Uber trip data using clustering techniques to uncover patterns in rider behavior, trip timings, and geographic activity. The main goal is to segment the data meaningfully and visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction.

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- 📈 Applied **K-Means Clustering** to identify patterns in Uber trip data
- 🧠 Used **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction
- 🗺️ Visualized clusters using scatter plots (2D PCA space)
- 🕒 Analyzed trip times by cluster (e.g., peak hours)
- 🧹 Cleaned and prepared real-world Uber data

---

## 🧪 Key Insights

- Clear separation between weekday and weekend trip patterns
- Certain clusters show concentrated requests in specific hours (e.g., morning rush or late-night)
- PCA allowed compact visualization of complex multidimensional data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📁 Files

- `Uber_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `uber.csv` — The cleaned dataset (optional, if included)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
2. Run all cells step-by-step
3. View clustering results and visualizations
